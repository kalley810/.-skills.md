# I have two favorite sports teams that I follow closly, these include the St. Louis Blues and the St. Louis Cardinals

-The St. Louis Blues are my favorite of the two to follow. I watch every game which is why the COVID-19 Virus cutting the season short was so sissapointing. I went to a game this season in February and we beat the Sabres 5-1. This is one of my favorite images regarding the Blues:

-The other team is the Cardinals, I don't follow them as closely but I do still enjoy watching games.
